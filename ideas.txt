- need to add filename field
- option to `add` file which takes a filename, querries googlebooks, fine isbn, prompts user for confirmation, make a copy of the book to books_dir.
- would be cool to integrate with good reads or something, applications have to talk to each other nowdays. I don't use it though, so who cares
- def need to think of a way to edit books, maybe restructured text to print the book in a text buffer, save and load it from there
